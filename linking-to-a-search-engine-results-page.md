title: Linking to a search engine results page
---

**Linking to a search engine results page**, such as a Google search results
page, can produce unexpected results because a [search engine results page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page)
changes rapidly and may even be personalized, leading to nonidentical content
for different people or across time.

> remember when the first google result for "commit message" used to be my blog
> post? how the mighty have fallen
