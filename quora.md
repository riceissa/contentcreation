**Quora** is a question and answer website.

Quora can be good in terms of gaining viewership, since for people who are not
established as writers, it is much easier to be read on Quora than to attract
readers to one's own site. On the other hand, Quora is a third-party site that
is not afraid of making radical decisions (for instance they eliminated private
blogs), so it is always a good idea to backup one's writings from there.

> likely give a month's notice (at least), and in that timeframe before
> they shutdown for good, you should have enough time to grab your
> content and save it somewhere (when large content-based websites go
> down, people usually build export tools for them. For example,
> Posterous).

> Quora).
