title: Static site

A **static site** is a website where the pages are sent to the user exactly as
stored. In order to achieve similar features as dynamic sites, a static site
generator and JavaScript can be used.

{% include toc.md %}

## History

## Examples

- This wiki is a static site: it uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
  static site generator. It also uses
  [AnchorJS](https://github.com/bryanbraun/anchorjs) for clickable anchors on
  section headings and Google Analytics for analytics, both of which are
  provided using JavaScript.
