A **timeline** is a content format in which events are organized
chronologically.

## Types

Timelines can take on various forms:

- A list, such as the [Timeline of psychiatry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_psychiatry)
  on the English Wikipedia.
- A table, such as most of the timelines on the [Timelines Wiki](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Main_Page)
- An interactive app, such as timelines created using [Tiki-Toki](https://www.tiki-toki.com/)

## Advantages

Timelines can be useful for understanding both the high-level and low-level
history of a topic. Timelines on Timelines Wiki usually have both a "big
picture" section as well as a "full timeline" section to serve these separate
purposes.

Unlike a prose narrative of history, a timeline is strictly chronological so
the reader does not get "lost" in the narrative (e.g. by confusing which event
came before another). If each event in the timeline provides context, it is
also easier to "jump in" to any point in the history and read from there
(whether forward or backward in time).

## Disadvantages

Most timelines do not provide an introduction to the topic, so if one uses just
a timeline, it can be difficult to understand the topic itself.
