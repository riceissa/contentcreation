title: Contribution style
---

If we take a broad view of the content creation pipeline, there are
many steps leading up to the publication of a piece of work:

- Brainstorming ideas
- Prototyping
- Writing up the final version
- Copyediting
- Giving feedback

In addition, if we consider just the final output format, there are
many styles:

- Blog post
- Book
- Wiki page
- Social media post (e.g., Facebook post)
- Academic paper

We can use the term "contribution style" to refer to both of these
choices. Why are some contribution styles more popular than others?
How do people decide what contribution style to use? Are some
contribution styles "better" than others? Why are some contribution
styles more socially or financially rewarded than others?

The "opposite" of contribution style might be "consumption style":
one's preferred consumption format for information. One can ask
similar questions like, should one prefer certain formats? How should
one reward the creation of work (e.g., principles for "liking" things
on Facebook)?

## Decision process

How do people decide what contribution style to use? In general, the
decision process seems to involve many factors (how fun it seems,
value produced, prestige, habit) and might not be fully conscious.
