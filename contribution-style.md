title: Contribution style
---

If we take a broad view of the content creation pipeline, there are
many steps leading up to the publication of a piece of work:

- Brainstorming ideas
- Prototyping
- Writing up the final version
- Copyediting
- Giving feedback

In addition, if we consider just the final output format, there are
many styles:

- Blog post
- Book
- Wiki page
- Social media post (e.g., Facebook post)
- Academic paper

We can use the term "contribution style" to refer to both of these
choices.

## Decision process

How do people decide what contribution style to use? In general, the
decision process seems to involve many factors (how fun it seems,
value produced, prestige, habit) and might not be fully conscious.
