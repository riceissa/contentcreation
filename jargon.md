title: Jargon
---

Many documents introduce or use **jargon**, terms that mean something new or
different from how the term is normally used. [Wikipedia
defines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon) jargon as "a type of language
that is used in a particular context and may not be well understood outside of
it".

When using jargon, there is the question of when to define it. Defining jargon
early ensures you don't waste readers' time. It is tedious to read an article
that adds no new insight other than a new phrase coined by an author for the
sake of their argument.
