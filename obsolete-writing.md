title: Obsolete writing
---

**Obsolete writing** refers to writing that has become obsolete due to
reasons including (1) the author has changed their mind on the
subject; (2) a better version of the same kind of document has been
published; (3) the writing had some purpose that it used to serve and
no longer serves (e.g. an advertisement for a product that no longer
exists). Note that even obsolete writing can be useful for archival,
anthropological, or legal purposes.

It is common for writing to become obsolete.

## Dealing with obsolete writing

There are various ways to deal with a piece of writing once it has
become obsolete:

- Delete the writing or allow it to be deleted (for instance, by not
  renewing a hosting fee).
- Do nothing.
- Mark the writing as obsolete.
- Alter the prominence of the writing among other pieces of writing
  (for instance, rather than linking to a piece from the homepage of
  the website, link to it from "the archives" or "old writings").
