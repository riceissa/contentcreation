title: Psychology of social media profile deletion
---

The **psychology of social media profile deletion** deals with what
goes on inside individuals' heads as they contemplate the deletion of
their social media profiles. What do people think about before
deleting their Facebook account? Why do some people habitually
deactivate their Facebook account? How do people feel before and after
deleting their Quora account? And so on.

This topic is interesting from a content creation perspective for two
reasons: (1) content that isn't saved is content that people in the
future won't be able to see, so by saving information from social
media profiles, it is possible to "create" content that people in the
future can see; (2) if so many people delete their social media
profiles, who is to say *we* aren't among those people?---in other
words, non-exceptionalism forces us to consider that our future selves
might delete the content we work so hard today to create.
