**Linking style** refers to how hyperlinks appear in a document. Some linking
styles are discussed on this page.

## Bare URLs/URIs

A bare URL or URI is the simplest style of linking, in which the URL or URI
itself appears in the body of the text. This style of linking is often used in
environments that do not support the concealing of the bare URL or URI, such as
a plaintext email, Facebook post, Facebook message, or Hacker News post.

Note that in some environments (such as a Facebook post), the bare URL is
truncated or abbreviated in parts with ellipses.

## Footnote style linking

## Numerical linking

## Linking verbs

## Linking nouns

## Linking as emphasis

## Linking adjacent words

This style of linking occurs when the writer wants to cite examples of a
particular thing, and links some adjacent words in a relevant part of the
sentence such that each word links out to a different example of the thing.
