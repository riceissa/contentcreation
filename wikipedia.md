Wikipedia, particularly the English Wikipedia, is a good place to submit
content if you can manage to get it to stick. This is because Wikipedia is
already popular so your content will receive more pageviews. On the other hand,
the tendency toward deletionism means it will be difficult to know what will
stick until you try, and you might have to engage in some [dark side editing](https://www.gwern.net/Wikipedia%20and%20Dark%20Side%20Editing)
in order to get content to stick, which *feels* "dirty".
