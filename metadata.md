title: Metadata

Content pages can have **metadata** associated with them that describe facts
about the pages themselves (rather than the *topics* that the pages deal with).
Content page metadata can be displayed on the pages themselves or be obtained
through other means (e.g. the Git repository that tracks the pages or a
separate revisions page).
