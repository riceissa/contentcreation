title: Metadata

Content pages can have **metadata** associated with them that describe facts
about the pages themselves (rather than the *topics* that the pages deal with).
Content page metadata can be displayed on the pages themselves or be obtained
through other means (e.g. the Git repository that tracks the pages or a
separate revisions page).

## History

## Examples

For content pages, the following metadata are some possibilities:

|Name|Possible values|Example usage|Description|
|----|---------------|-------------|-----------|
|[Epistemic status]({% link epistemic-status.md %})|||Also called "belief" or "confidence" by some authors.|
|[Versioning]({% link versioning.md %}) information||||
|Conflicts of interest information||||
|Authorship||||

## Metadata tables

Metadata for a set of content pages can be collected and displayed in a
metadata table. Examples are:

- The [all pages](https://issarice.com/all-pages) page on Issa Rice's website.
- The [gwern.net metadata table](https://issarice.com/gwern-net-metadata-table)
  created by Issa Rice for Gwern Branwen's website.
